/*
Some signs for identifying Software Rot
1. Rigidity: small changes leads to rebuild the entire software.
2. Fragility: changes to one component causes other unrelated components to misbehave.
3. Immobility: if a component cannot be used in another system, this component is considered as immobile.
Immobility usually is caused by couplings and dependencies among various components.
4. Viscosity: when implementing and testing are difficult to perform, and also take a long time to execute.
